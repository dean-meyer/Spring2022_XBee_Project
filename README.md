### Spring 2022 Undergraduate Physics Research Project </br>
This repository is for my Spring 2022 Undergraduate Physics Research Project at [Augusta University](https://www.augusta.edu/scimath/chemistryandphysics/index.php), advised by [Dr. Andy Hauger](https://www.augusta.edu/scimath/chemistryandphysics/andyhauger.php). </br></br>
The purpose of this project was to create an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) controlled [XBee](https://www.digi.com/xbee) system to enable the wireless transmission of data from remote sensors, this test case was remote transmission of GPS data using XBee radios and an Adafruit GPS module. </br></br>
The output as currently configured is:
