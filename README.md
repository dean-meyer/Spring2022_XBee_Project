### Spring 2022 Undergraduate Physics Research Project </br>
This repository is for my Spring 2022 Undergraduate Physics Research Project at [Augusta University](https://www.augusta.edu/scimath/chemistryandphysics/index.php), advised by [Dr. Andy Hauger](https://www.augusta.edu/scimath/chemistryandphysics/andyhauger.php). </br></br>
The purpose of this project was to create an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) controlled [XBee](https://www.digi.com/xbee) system to enable the wireless transmission of data from remote sensors. Two example uses are included in this repository. ledTransmitReceive uses XBee radios to remotely turn on an LED and gpsTransmitReceive uses XBee radios to  transmit data from a remote Adafruit GPS module to a local XBee receiver.</br></br>
The GPS data as received is currently configured to display the following data:
