### Spring 2022 Undergraduate Physics Research Project </br>
This repository is for my Spring 2022 Undergraduate Physics Research Project at [Augusta University](https://www.augusta.edu/scimath/chemistryandphysics/index.php), advised by [Dr. Andy Hauger](https://www.augusta.edu/scimath/chemistryandphysics/andyhauger.php). </br>
The purpose of this project was to create an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) controlled [XBee](https://www.digi.com/xbee) system to allow for the wireless communication of data from remote sensors. The code in this repository includes basic XBee communication, remote LED control, and remote transmission of parsed GPS data.
